You are [@myBlog](http://twitter.com/myBlog), but who am I?

Well, I'm a Spanish architect interested in IT, or maybe an IT guy (web developer and sysadmin) who studied Architecture. Some years ago I started to work at an IT company where I learned some interesting things about Linux, Web and PHP development, etc.

Finally, I've decide to write a weblog to share some interesting things with everybody who want to read about them. That things will be primarily related with Architecture, IT or both, but I will write about everything I want.

Sometimes, I will post in English (or something which looks like English), sometimes in Spanish, sometimes both; but I promise to tag every post so you can subscribe only the language you want.

That's all folks. Enjoy it.
