## Antonio J. Garc√≠a Lagar.

I'm the IT guy in a <abbr title="Small and Medium-sized Business">SMB</abbr>: <abbr title="Chief Technology Officer">CTO</abbr>, Web developer, System Administrator, Network Administrator, Manual Reader, etc. Some call it ***DevOps***.

### Architect.

I came to Madrid in 1997 to study Architecture in the [Superior Technical School of Architecture of Madrid](http://etsamadrid.aq.upm.es). To work on my CAD exercises, my parents bought me my first computer, and I had to reinstall the OS Windows 95 three times in a week.

In 1998 I got a Mandrake **Linux** CD, and I had to compile the kernel to solve some issues with the installation without knowing the meaning of *compile* or *kernel*: it was my first contact with the **Free Software** world.

In 2001, to pay for my studies, I started to work in an IT company where I still work, and where I had the opportunity to follow my self-taught career, always reading and learning.

### Web Architect.
In 2004, after some years interested in **Sysadmin** tasks, I read my first programming book (about Modula2), where I discovered a new passion: the **Software Development**.

In 2005, we completely rewrote our main app with a <abbr title="Linux, Apache, PostgreSQL, PHP">LAPP</abbr> architecture, and during this process became a **Web Developer**, with **PHP** as my main programming language.

After finishing my studies of Architecture, I opted to continue my career in the IT world.

And I'm still here; reading, learning and enjoying every day with my self-taught learning, with the help of lot of people that share their knowing selflessly through the net.
