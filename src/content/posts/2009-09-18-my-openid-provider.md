Well, I've reset my digital identity: new [twitter](http://twitter.com/ajgarlag) and [identi.ca](http://indenti.ca/ajgarlag) usernames, new [last.fm](http://last.fm/user/ajgarlag) account, new [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/ajgarlag) (I prefer the old domain ðŸ˜Š) account, etc.

Some time ago I was looking for an [OpenID](http://openid.net) identity, but I've never subscribed any account. With my new personal domain, an idea came to my head: why not install my personal OpenID provider?

I've found several free [PHP](http://php.net) implementations, but I wanted the simplest one and finally found it: [PhpMyId](http://siege.org/projects/phpMyID). The installation is very easy, and I love how this little piece of software implements the [HTTP Digest access authentication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digest_access_authentication), so you don't have to enable [SSL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) at the web server.

That's all folks.

My OpenID is [aj.garcialagar.es](http://aj.garcialagar.es)
