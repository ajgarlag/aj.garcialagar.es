After last [PHPMad](http://phpmad.org "PHP Madrid User Group") meetup, I was talking with other two group members about our daily work with the [Syfmony](http://www.symfony.com) framework and the Symfony Ecosystem. One of them told me that he loves Twig but sometimes he would like to set a breakpoint in a [Twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org) template to debug generated code and the variables passed to the template.

Last week I had some time to investigate this and found a simple way to accomplish this creating a **Twig Extension** with a new **breakpoint** function. This new function will detect if the **XDebug** extension is installed and then it will the **xdebug_break** function to stop the debug sessi√≥n.

I've created a [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) package called [**ajgl/breakpoint-twig-extension**](https://packagist.org/packages/ajgl/breakpoint-twig-extension) that you can install with:
```bash
$ composer require ajgl/breakpoint-twig-extension
```

Once installed and configured, the new funcion can be called inside your twig template:
```twig
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    {{'{{'}} breakpoint() {{'}}'}}
  </body>
</html>
```

Remember that you must register the extension within the twig environment with
```php
/* @var $twig Twig_Environment */
$twig->addExtension(new Ajgl\Twig\Extension\BreakpointExtension());
```

If you are writing a Symfony Application, you can use the provided bundle (included with the package) which will register the extension automatically:
```php
// app/AppKernel.php
use Ajgl\Twig\Extension\SymfonyBundle\AjglBreakpointTwigExtensionBundle();

if (in_array($this->getEnvironment(), array('dev', 'test'), true)) {
    $bundles[] = new AjglBreakpointTwigExtensionBundle();
}
```

### Extra tip for Netbeans users

If you are using Netbeans IDE and want to debug the PHP code generated by twig in an standard Symfony app, you must uncheck the **Ignore &#8220;app/cache&#8221; Directory** inside the _Frameworks/Symfony2_ category in the _Project Properties_ window.
