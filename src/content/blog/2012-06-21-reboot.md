More than one year ago I wrote my last post, now I'm here again trying to reboot the blog.

In these months several I started several projects and most of them are already dead, so I won't write about them. But one of these projects is still alive, and I think it will be a long term project.

It's my other blog [TRESiYO](http://tresiyo.com/blog) where I write with a friend [@nono_martin](http://twitter.com/nono_martin) about architecture (about buildings, not computers). It's written in Spanish, but we have a widget to translate it with the help of Google Translate, so you can read it in something that seems to be English.

I hope to write something interesting here soon.
