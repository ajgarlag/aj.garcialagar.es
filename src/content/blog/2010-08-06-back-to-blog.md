Long time since my last post, but as you can see at the @NET block at the sidebar, I'm still alive.

These past months I've been very busy at work with the [PAPI](http://papi.redires.es "In Spanish (Point of Access for Information Providers)"): the SSO software provided by [RedIRIS](http://rediris.es) which is being used by some of our clients to provide their users an ubiquitous access to remote electronic resources protected by IP.

My other work as teacher of **Web Languages and Technologies** at the [III Master in Digital and Multimedia Communication of the Architectural Project](http://www.arquigrafia.es) at the [ETSAM](http://aq.upm.es) (High Technical School of Architecture of Madrid) went very well. Although it has been my first time as teacher, I collaborated some years ago with [Jesús Rodríguez Santiago](http://ocw.upm.es/mecanica-de-medios-continuos-y-teoria-de-estructuras/practica-en-proyecto-de-estructuras-de-hormigon/autores) teaching [**Design of building concrete structure**](http://ocw.upm.es/mecanica-de-medios-continuos-y-teoria-de-estructuras/practica-en-proyecto-de-estructuras-de-hormigon). Working with him I learned a lot and this has been very helpful this year.

On the other hand, my Thesis (_I feel this is not the perfect translation to describe the final project to finish the college_) went not so well, because I have not spent all the necessary time to work on it. But after vacations, I'll make an extra effort to finish it.

Well, this is a little summary of the last months. I'll try to write soon something interesting not about me, but about PHP and Continous Integration.
